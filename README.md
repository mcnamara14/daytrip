## Description

This app is built in React using Redux and Router in combination with Firebase. 

It allows users to select an event in any city along with type of restaurant and bar and price range for each. The app returns 3 plans that match all criteria based on the best reviewed restaurants and bars within walking distance of the event. Directions to and from each stop are provided as well as a link to purchase a ticket to the event after selecting a plan. 

Users who have signed in are able to log back into the app to view their selected plan.
